The SOLID principles are five design principles that help software developers create robust, maintainable, and flexible code. Although originally devised for object-oriented programming, these principles are also applicable to JavaScript.

`S` - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

`O` - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

`L` - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

`I` - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

`D` - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
